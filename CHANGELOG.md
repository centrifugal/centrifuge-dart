## [0.7.0]

Update to work with Centrifuge >= v0.18.0 and Centrifugo v3.

**Breaking change** in server behavior. Client History API behavior changed in Centrifuge >= v0.18.0 and Centrifugo >= v3.0.0. When using history call it won't return all publications in a stream by default. See Centrifuge [v0.18.0 release notes](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge/releases/tag/v0.18.0) or [Centrifugo v3 migration guide](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/getting-started/migration_v3) for more information and workaround on server-side.

* Protocol definitions updated to the latest version 
* History method now accepts optional `limit`, `since` and `reverse` arguments and returns `HistoryResult`
* RPC call now requires method name as first argument (you can pass empty string to mimic previous behavior)
* Publish now returns `PublishResult`
* When working with Centrifugo v3 or Centrifuge >= v0.18.0 it's now possible to avoid using `?format=protobuf` in connection URL. Client will negotiate Protobuf protocol with a server using WebSocket subprotocol mechanism (in request headers).

## [0.6.0]

Null safety migration

* library dependencies updated to null safe versions
* library code updated to support null safety in places where required

See issue [#47](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart/issues/47) and pull request [#48](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart/pull/48) for details.
