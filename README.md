[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart)

Websocket client for [Centrifugo](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo) server and [Centrifuge](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge) library. 

There is no v1 release of this library yet â€“ API still evolves. At the moment patch version updates only contain backwards compatible changes, minor version updates can have backwards incompatible API changes.

Check out [client SDK API specification](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/transports/client_api) to learn how this SDK behaves. It's recommended to read that before starting to work with this SDK as the spec covers common SDK behavior - describes client and subscription state transitions, main options and methods. Also check out examples folder.

The features implemented by this SDK can be found in [SDK feature matrix](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/transports/client_sdk#sdk-feature-matrix).

Note that connection headers can only be set on platforms that support `dart:io`. So notably headers are ignored on the web platform.

> **The latest `centrifuge-dart` is compatible only with the latest [Centrifugo](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo) server (v4) and [Centrifuge](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge) >= 0.25.0. For Centrifugo v2, Centrifugo v3 and Centrifuge < 0.25.0 you should use `centrifuge-dart` v0.8.0.**

## Examples

* `example\flutter_app` simple chat application
* `example\chat_app` one more chat example
* `example\console` simple console application

## Usage in background

When a mobile application goes to the background there are OS-specific limitations for established persistent connections - which can be silently closed shortly. Thus in most cases you need to disconnect from a server when app moves to the background and connect again when app goes to the foreground.
