[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart?branch=master)

## Example

Examples:
* `example\flutter_app` simple chat application
* `example\console` simple console application 

## Usage

Create client:

```dart
import 'package:centrifuge/centrifuge.dart' as centrifuge;

final client = centrifuge.createClient("ws://localhost:8000/connection/websocket?format=protobuf");
```

**Note that** `?format=protobuf` **is required because this library only works with Protobuf protocol.**

Connect to server:
```dart
client.connect();
```

Note that `.connect()` method is asynchronous. This means that client will be properly connected and authenticated on server at some point in future. To handle connect and disconnect events you can listen to `connectStream` and `disconnectStream`:

```dart
client.connectStream.listen(onEvent);
client.disconnectStream.listen(onEvent);
client.connect();
```

Connect and disconnect events can happen many times throughout client lifetime.

Subscribe to channel:

```dart
final subscription = client.getSubscription(channel);

subscription.publishStream.listen(onEvent);
subscription.joinStream.listen(onEvent);  
subscription.leaveStream.listen(onEvent);
subscription.subscribeSuccessStream.listen(onEvent);
subscription.subscribeErrorStream.listen(onEvent);
subscription.unsubscribeStream.listen(onEvent);

subscription.subscribe();
```

Publish:
```dart
final output = jsonEncode({'input': message});
final data = utf8.encode(output);
await subscription.publish(data);
```
